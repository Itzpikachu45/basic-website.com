            Computer Monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or text form. A
            monitor
            usually comprises a visual display, some circuitry, a casing, and a power supply. display device in
            modern monitors is typically a thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED
            backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting. Previous monitors
            used a
            cathode-ray tube (CRT) and some plasma (also called gas-plasma) displays. Monitors are connected to
            the
            computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C, low-voltage differential
            signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.<br>

            Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television sets were used for
            entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data
            processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The
            common
            aspect ratio of televisions, and computer monitors, has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9. <br>

            Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets and vice
            versa.
            However, as many computer monitors do not include integrated speakers nor TV Tuners (such as digital
            television adapters), it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a TV set without external
            components </p>

    <div class="head">II. what is CPU?</div>

    <p class="para">A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor,
        is
        the
        electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic
        arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the
        program.The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental
        operation
        remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmeticâ€“logic unit (ALU) that
        performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store
        the
        results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and
        execution (of instructions) by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other
        components.</p>

    <h1 class="keyboard">III. what is KEYBOARD?</h1>
    <p class="Ans2"> A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer. Similar to an electric
        typewriter,
        a
        keyboard is composed of buttons used to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional
        functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to some of the
        frequently
        asked questions about the keyboard.
        The horizontal rows of character keys in the typing area have specific names. For example, when placing
        your
        hands on the keyboard, they should be positioned over the home row keys. The keys below the home row are
        called the bottom row keys, and above the home row keys are the top row keys
    </p>

    <p class="qwerty">Below is a close-up image of a QWERTY computer keyboard with each of the keys selectable. You may
        hover your
        mouse cursor over any of the keys to see a description. Clicking any of the keys opens a new page with full
        details.

    <h1 class="mouse">IV. what is MOUSE?</h1>
    <p class="Ans3"> A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that detects
        two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a
        pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.

        The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Mice originally
        used
        two separate wheels to track movement across a surface: one in the X-dimension and one in the Y. Later,
        the
        standard design shifted to utilize a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion. Most modern mice use
        optical sensors that have no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a
        cable, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected
        system. </p>
